# GameEssentials

### Bugs to Fix:

- Inside dot does not change color with match
- Instances can overlap each other
- Instances can accidentally make matches
- Rings should disappear when "no match" event is triggered
- Instancing should stop at Game Over
- 321Go! Coroutine should play on restart
- Game can only restart once... the no match event doesn't start over

### Bugs Fixed:
- Animations not working on 321Go! coroutine
- Score and High Score do not update with match events
